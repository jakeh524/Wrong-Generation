# Wrong Generation

https://wrong-generation.herokuapp.com/

Wrong Generation is a web application that allows users to search up a date in history and find the top songs on the Billboard Hot 100. It utilizes a React frontend, NodeJS/Express backend, and a MongoDB database. Additionally, it includes functionality from the Spotify API to provide accurate track metadata and links to song and artist pages. Click the link above to check it out!

Do you think the music of today sucks? Was music better when you were born? Maybe you were born in the wrong generation! This app lets you look up the songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 during any week in history (or at least the last 50 years or so). Find out what songs were trending on your birthday. Or during that important historical moment. Or maybe even when your parents met. ;)

The utilites folder also includes Python scripts that made up an earlier command line version of the application. There is a webscraper that was used to gather all of the data and place it in an SQLite database. Then, another Python script was used to transfer this data to a MongoDB Atlas database when this project was converted to a web app.
